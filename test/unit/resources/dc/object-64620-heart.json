	"description": "Heart of the race horse Phar Lap. Phar Lap's heart weighs 6.35kg which is significantly larger than an average horse heart of three to four kilograms. A triangular section has been removed. The heart is preserved as a 'wet specimen' submersed in a formalin solution, sealed inside a rectangular clear perspex container.",
	"contentDescription": "Phar Lap was a late foal, born on 4 October 1926. He had been bred in New Zealand and sold for 160 pounds as Lot 41 at the annual Trentham Yearling Sales in 1927. Harry Telford, a down-on-his-luck Sydney trainer, had spotted the chestnut colt in the sale catalogue and thought that, with the horse's pedigree, it had the potential to become a success. He persuaded American businessman David J Davis to purchase the colt sight unseen. Upon first seeing his new horse, Davis is reported to have said simply, &quot;Harry, I don't like the horse.&quot;  Davis wanted nothing more to do with the ugly colt, who was gangly and had a face covered in warts. Davis and Telford came to an agreement, whereby Telford would cover the costs associated with the horse as part of a 3-year lease.",
	"provenance": "This is the preserved heart of the race horse Phar Lap, a champion racehorse in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It is unusually large - 6.2 kg against the average 4 kg size of a horse's heart. A triangular section has been removed, which it is believed was taken for a biopsy. The heart is preserved as a 'wet specimen' submersed in a formalin solution, sealed inside a rectangular clear perspex container. Other parts of Phar Lap are held by other museums - his skeleton is at the Museum  of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, and his hide is at Museum Victoria.",
