Harry Telford, a down-on-his-luck Sydney trainer, had spotted the chestnut colt in the sale catalogue and thought that, with the horse's pedigree, it had the potential to become a success. He persuaded American businessman David J Davis to purchase the colt sight unseen. Upon first seeing his new horse, Davis is reported to have said simply, \"Harry, I don't like the horse.\" Davis wanted nothing more to do with the ugly colt, who was gangly and had a face covered in warts. Davis and Telford came to an agreement, whereby Telford would cover the costs associated with the horse as part of a 3-year lease.",

The heart is preserved as a 'wet specimen' submersed in a formalin solution, sealed inside a rectangular clear perspex container. Other parts of Phar Lap are held by other museums - his skeleton is at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, and his hide is at Museum Victoria.",
